## FASTAI EXPERIMENT TRACKER

This tool helps to save all data from your jupyter notebook into the project folder, so you could repeat experiment later.
Experiment tracker can create backup of used dataset, extract parameters and save graphs and matrices. You just need to provide path to your notebook.
Aim of this project is to provide most efficient automated way of tracking your progress without extra efforts. It is kinda rough for now, but it will be improved.
